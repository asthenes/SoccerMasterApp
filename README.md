# SoccerMaster App

This is a simple app that takes in streaming data from pipes, redirects, or file paths and attempts to get results for a soccer league.
It's built using typescript and node.js, tests with jest, and uses yarn for package management.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies and build
yarn install
yarn build
yarn cli -f

# Now you can run various yarn commands:
yarn cli
yarn lint
yarn test
yarn ts-node <filename>
...
```
